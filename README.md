# WebSocket Inspector

WebSocket Inspector is a developer tool for testing WebSocket clients. Provides a WebSocket server and the UI to inspect and interact with the clients connected to the server.

You can use it to test and debug your WebSocket client applications mocking the messages provided by the service you are working with without having to use it.

It is multiplatform and can run on Windows, MacOS or Linux.
